# Animation

The animation option makes the pointer to rotate from minimum value to actual value with animation effects.  Animation could be enabled/disabled by using the `EnableAnimation` property.  Speed of the pointer could be controlled by using the `AnimationSpeed` property. Time is represented in milliseconds.
