# Overview

The Dialog control displays a Dialog window within a webpage. The Dialog enables a message to be displayed, such as supplementary content like images and text and interactive content like forms. The control can be used to display content on a modal Dialog, but the users cannot interact with other items on the page while the Dialog is open. The Dialog can also be dragged and resized.

## Key Features

* Drag support: Drags the Dialog within the page.
* AJAX Load: Loads AJAX content in the Dialog content panel.
* Dialog resize: The Dialog control can be resized.
* Customized Dialog position: By default, the Dialog is shown in the center of the container. When a position is specified, the Dialog is displayed at the particular position.
* Content type: AJAX, iframe, or image content can be loaded in the Dialog content panel.
* Model Dialog support: Displays the content in a modal dialog, disabling interaction with other items on the page.
* Display header: Enables or disables the Dialog header element.
* Built-in icon options: Sets of icons are included for Dialog headers and are coupled with specific actions like close, collapsible, maximize, minimize, custom, and pin.
* RTL: The Dialog content panel supports displaying right-to-left language text.
* Theme: Essential JavaScript control features 12 built-in themes (six flat themes and six with gradient effects), and also supports custom skin options to set user-defined themes.
* Keyboard navigation: Users can interact with the Dialog by using the keyboard.
