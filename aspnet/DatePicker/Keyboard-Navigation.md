# Keyboard Navigation

With the Keyboard Navigation enabled in the DatePicker control, it is possible to control the actions of the DatePicker with the provided shortcut keys. Almost all the DatePicker actions that are done through mouse are controlled with shortcut keys. By default, the keyboard navigation is set to true for the control and it is controlled with the property AllowKeyboardNavigation.

The various keyboard shortcuts available within the DatePicker control are discussed in the following table.

{% endhighlight %}





{% highlight js %}



          $(function () {



              $(document).on("keydown", function (e) {

                  if (e.altKey && e.keyCode === 74) { // j- key code.

                      $("#<%=datepicker.ClientID %>").focus();

                  }

              });
