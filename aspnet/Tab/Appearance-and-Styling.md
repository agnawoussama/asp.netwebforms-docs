{% highlight html %}

<ej:Tab ID="dishtype" runat="server" Width="600px">

    <Items>

        <ej:TabItem ID="pizzatype" ImageCssClass="dish pizzaImg" Text="Pizza Menu">

            <ContentSection>

                <p>

                    Pizza cooked to perfection tossed with milk, vegetables, potatoes, poultry, 100% pure mutton, and cheese - and in creating nutritious and tasty meals to maintain good health.</p>

            </ContentSection>

        </ej:TabItem>

            <ContentSection>

                <p>

        </ej:TabItem>

    </Items>

</ej:Tab>

{% endhighlight %}

Add the following CSS for header image customization.

{% highlight css %}

.dish {

	display: inline-block;

	vertical-align: middle;

	margin: 0px -9px 0px 9px;           

}
