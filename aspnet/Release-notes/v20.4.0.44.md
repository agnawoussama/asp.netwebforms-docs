# Essential Studio for ASP.NET  Release Notes  

{% include release-info.html date="January 18, 2023"  version="v20.4.0.44" %} 

## Common

### Breaking changes

It was announced in 2019 that the Syncfusion ASP.NET WebForms components would no longer be actively developed. Despite this, support and bug fixes were provided for the last four years. However, the 2022 Volume 4 release marked the end of support for the Syncfusion ASP.NET WebForms components. We recommend upgrading to the Syncfusion ASP.NET Core components of Essential JS 2 or the Syncfusion Blazor components, which are designed to be lightweight and modular. 
For more information, visit the [ASP.NET Core documentation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetcore/documentation/introduction) and [ASP.NET Core demo](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetcore/Grid/GridOverview) pages, or [Blazor documentation](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/introduction) and [Blazor demo](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/demos/).
