# Angular Binding

AngularBinding is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It allows you to use HTML as your template language and extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.

In order to achieve AngularBinding, refer the following script files.

* angular.min.js
* ej.widget.angular.min.js
