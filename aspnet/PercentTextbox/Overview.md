# Overview

Essential ASP.NET Editors include Numeric, Percentage and Currency Text Box controls. These controls have Spin buttons to increase or decrease the values in the Text Box. PercentageTextBox is used to display only percentage values. 

### Key Features

* Min and Max Values—Specifies value range for the Text Box.
* Spin Buttons—Enables you to increase or decrease the current value in the Text Box.
* Step Value—Enables you to increment or decrement the current value by step value.
* Localization— Essential JavaScript Text Boxes provide localization support. These controls use Globalize.js, a simple JavaScript library that enables you to globalize and localize the format, and parse numbers and dates according to the culture. For more information on Globalize.js, seen [GitHub Here](https://github.com/jquery/globalize).
* Keyboard Navigation—You can interact with Text Boxes by using keyboard.
* RTL Support—Support for right to left alignment of Text Box input.
* Decimal Values—You can configure Text Boxes to accept decimal values.
* Themes—Essential JavaScript Text Boxes consist of 13 built-in themes (6 – flat 6 – gradient effects and 1 bootstrap theme), and also support custom skins for creating user-defined themes.
