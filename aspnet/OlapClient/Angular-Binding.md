# Angular Binding

Angular Binding is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.

In order to achieve angular binding, refer the following script files.

* angular.min.js
* ej.widget.angular.min.js
